<h2>Hello! In this guide we will teach you how to make a schedule with all your meeting links in Google Sheets.</h2>

<p> This guide assumes that you know how to copy and paste, so if you don't know how to do that, check out our second guide <a href="http://foorwile.me/organization-and-focus-in-remote-learning/Howtocopypasteenglish/">here</a>! 1. First, open up your browser and get to the Google page. If your default browser isn't Google, just click <a href="https://www.google.com/">here</a> to get there! </p>

<p>2. Then, click the symbol shown in the picture here, the grid of nine circles. Inside will be a green page that has a white grid on that called "Sheets". Click this next.</p>

<p>3. You should see a white box with a rainbow plus sign. Clicking that will make a new spreadsheet for you to make your schedule in!</p>

<div style="background-color: #ebc55b;">
<p>4. This is what the blank sheet will look like! All the boxes can be filled with text.</p>

</div>

<div style="background-color: #e3b944;">
<p>5. First, add all the times your classes start and end. They should go in the spots shown in this image, on the far left. Then, add all the days of your school week on the top row.</p>

</div>

<div style="background-color: #d4aa37;">
<p>6. Then, add in all the names of your classes. They should be in the COLUMN of the time they take place, and in the ROW beneath the day they take place. The makers of this website have a study day on Wednesdays, so there are no classes there. </p>

<div style="background-color: #dbb858;">
<p>7. To add the link to your meeting to a class, first click the box the class's name is in. Only click it one time, or click it so that it appears like in this picture. Clicking it twice will make it look different and have different results. </p>

<p>8. Then, RIGHT CLICK the box you've selected.</p>

<div style="background-color: #dbc484;">
<p>9. This should cause a very large box of text to appear. Click the "insert link" option, the one highlighted in RED in the image below. It has a little picture of a chain link in it. </p>

</div>

<div style="background-color: #deca95;">
<p>10. A box with two bars will appear. Select the bottom bar and PASTE your meeting link in here.</p>

</div>

<div style="background-color: #d9cca9;">
<p>11. Once that's done, the APPLY button should be green! The button is circled in this picture in RED. Click it.</p>

</div>

<div style="background-color: #d4cab2;">
<p>12. Now your link is a part of the text! Whenever you click the name of your class, this box will appear. Clicking the long link on the bottom will take you to your class meeting!</p>

<p>Repeat the above steps until you have a full schedule!</p>
