How to Copy and Paste
</head>
<body>
On Most Computers:
First, highlight the text you wish to copy by clicking and dragging over it.
Next, hold down the "control" button.
To copy the text, press "c" while still holding "control."
Release both keys. Navigate to where you want to paste the text and click exactly where you want it to go.
To paste, hold the "control" button again, but this time press "v."
You should see your text show up exactly as you copied it!

IF THE ABOVE DOES NOT WORK: Follow the steps as outlined above, but use the "command" key instead of the "control" key.
Apple computers almost always require this switch.

On iPhone:
Double tap one word of the text you wish to copy.
Drag the blue cursors on either end to highlight the entire phrase.
Tap the highlighted section once and a menu will show up above the highlighted section.
Select "copy"
Double tap to get rid of the highlight and scroll to where you want to paste your text.
Tap to move your cursor, and then tap the cursor to make a menu appear above again.
Select "paste" and you should see your text appear where you want!
