<p> On Most Computers:
First, highlight the text you wish to copy by clicking and dragging over it.</p>

<p> Next, hold down the "control" button. </p>
<img src=""
alt="">
<p> To copy the text, press the "c" key while still holding "control." </p>
<img src=""
alt="">
<p> Release both keys. Navigate to where you want to paste the text and click exactly where you want it to go. </p>
<img src=""

<p> To paste, hold the "control" button again, but this time press "v." </p>

<p> You should see your text show up exactly as you copied it! </p>

<p> IF THE ABOVE DOES NOT WORK: Follow the steps as outlined above, but use the "command" key instead of the "control" key.
Apple computers almost always require this switch. </p>
